We establish a number of elementary properties, e.g. we provide conditions that ensure that the invariance feedback entropy is finite and show that for the deterministic case, we recover the well-known notion of entropy for deterministic control systems. We prove the data rate theorem, which shows that the invariance entropy is a tight lower bound of the data rate of any coder-controller that achieves invariance in the closed loop. We analyze uncertain linear control systems and derive a universal lower bound of the invariance feedback entropy. The lower bound depends on the absolute value of the determinant of the system matrix and a ratio involving the volume of the invariant set and the set of uncertainties.'

In this talk, we develop an information-theoretic cost function from first principles and show that it includes previously proposed cost functions as special cases. We furthermore propose a simple optimization heuristic and illustrate its performance on examples from natural language processing and data clustering.'

In this presentation, we consider the example of a multiple-loop networked control system (NCS), where all control loops share a communication network. Medium Access Control (MAC) is performed based on information about the control system. We show our initial results of how such joint consideration can achieve a significant improvement in system performance for Cyber Physical Networking.'

In this talk a hybrid method will be presented that uses machine learning for speeding up the RRT algorithm. Current research results will be shown as well as an approach that uses online machine learning for clustering the driver\'s motion planning in various traffic scenarios. These clusters can be used as a bias in sampling algorithms, leading to a significant reduction of the computation time, especially in complex scenarios with many dynamic traffic participants.'

A sensor transmits local state estimates over a packet dropping link to a remote estimator, while an eavesdropper can successfully overhear each sensor transmission with a certain probability. The objective is to determine when the sensor should transmit, in order to minimize the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator, while trying to keep the eavesdropper error covariance above a certain level. Structural results on the optimal transmission policy are derived, and shown to exhibit thresholding behaviour in the estimation error covariances. For unstable systems, it is shown that in the infinite horizon situation there exist transmission policies which can keep the expected estimation error covariance bounded, while the expected eavesdropper error covariance becomes unbounded. An alternative measure of security constraining the amount of information revealed to the eavesdropper will also be described. In the infinite horizon situation, it is now shown that for any transmission policy which keeps the expected estimation error covariance bounded, the expected amount of information revealed to the eavesdropper is always lower bounded away from zero.'

The objective is to decide, at every discrete time instant, whether the sensor should transmit or not, in order to minimize the expected estimation error covariance at the remote estimator. Within this setup, we obtain structural results on the optimal scheduling and shed light into the role played by threshold policies. We then consider the problem of transmission scheduling and control with an energy harvesting sensor, which can be shown to be separable into a control problem and a transmission scheduling problem. The optimal controller is then given as the solution to a linear-quadratic-Gaussian-type problem, while the structural results for transmission scheduling in the remote state estimation setup discussed can be extended to this situation as well.'

			content: 'Due to the interconnectedness of smart technologies, the importance of decision making over communication networks grows bigger and bigger in our modern society. Closing feedback loops over networks introduces new challenges regarding how to use limited computation, communication, and energy resources efficiently. The traditional time-triggered control paradigm, unfortunately, is only based on performing sensing and actuation actions periodically in time rather than when the system needs attention. Therefore, event- and self-triggered algorithms have appeared as an alternative to time-triggered algorithms in both estimation and control to manage limited energy, communication, and computation resources while still ensuring closed-loop stability and performance. This talk will consider multiple linear stochastic control systems whose feedback loops are closed over a shared communication medium. A threshold-based event-triggering rule is used to transmit measurements from the sensors to the controllers, and network access is arbitrated using a static priority mechanism. Under these conditions, we study optimal control laws and compute the expected linear-quadratic loss of the closed-loop system as a function of the event thresholds of the individual loops. This talk will present analytical expressions that quantify the trade-off between the communication cost and the control performance of such event-triggered control systems. Simulation studies highlight the trade-off between the communication and control cost.'
